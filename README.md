# 100-Days-of-Coding

As I attempt to navigate the world of coding, I wanted to document my journey. 

Day 1: Navigate GitHub and establish my first repository. Total amount of time spent on day 1 was 1 hour. During the hour I followed the Git Hub guide for setting up my GitHub account. 

Day 2: Worked on coding for one hour. 

Day 3: Continued to work on coding of HTML and class tags. Had to call it after an hour due to the wife wathcing Netflix next to me! 

Day 4: Another good night HTML front end coding. Worked just shy of 2 hours before I called it. 

Day 5: Lets see if I can get another two hours of coding done! Worked for about a solid hour before I moved on. Focus is still reworkingn through the HTML5 and CSS front end certification path.
